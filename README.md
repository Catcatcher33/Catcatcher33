- 👋 Hi there, I'm Morgane, a 2nd year Computer Science undergraduate student at UCL
- 🎮 I spend my free time gaming, drawing and coding
- 🖌 Currently the UCL Graphic Novels & Comics Society President
- 🔭 I'm currently working on [modus](https://github.com/modus-continens/modus.git), a Dockerfile alternative
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Rust and working on creating small but useful programs 
-  ⚡ I love creative ways to create and implement clean and organised code! That includes finding and exploiting vulnerabilities (in an ethical way 😉)
- 📫 You can contact me at [morgane.ohlig@gmail.com](mailto:morgane.ohlig@gmail.com)
